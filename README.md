# GOES AGAINST

A tool to keep artists, sex workers, and marginalized people (whose existence goes against popular social media's vague community guidelines) in contact with their community and sources of income.

Goes Against is an inclusive, zero censorship, platform that allows its members to create a "link in bio" which will display links to any other websites or social media platforms where they can be found. But more importantly, it implements a mailing list feature that a member may not have had access to if they did not have a personal website. With this feature, any visitor can sign up to receieve updates from a member in the event that they are deplatformed.

Designed with comic relief in mind, this web application takes a minimalist approach in adopting the appearance of Craigslist Personals. A space taken down by the same force causing mass deletion across social media platforms, FOSTA/SESTA.
